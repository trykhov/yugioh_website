# My Rendition of Konami's Yu-Gi-Oh! Webiste

As a kid, I was a huge fan of the Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and card game. Recently, I got back into the anime and game via the mobile app, Duel Links.
So, in exploring and revisiting the website (https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/), I surprised to find that the website felt outdated.
It was not responsiveness and the design felt messy.

This is their current site:

My rendition followed a different philosophy. As a card game, I felt that Konami's main priority is to sell their cards. So I needed to make it look as appealing and exciting to their audience as much as possible. In addition, I wanted to utilize much of the space as opposed to the original site as you can see from its sides.

As you can see, the products are on the home page. While there are mentions of tournaments and events, they are small relative to the products. In addition, I wanted to utilize much of the space.

The images aren't as great as they could be because I pulled them from the website themselves. The products were the only images that I could pull that had transparent backgrounds.
